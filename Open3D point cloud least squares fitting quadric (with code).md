#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. Overview of the principle 

   The quadratic surface equation is as follows: the least squares method is used to fit the local quadratic surface, and the objective function is established as: the joint vertical equation (1) and the equation (2), the partial derivative of the coefficients is obtained, and the partial derivative is equal to zero to obtain the linear equation system, see the equation (3), solve the linear equation system, and obtain the local quadratic fitting surface equation.
