#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

   There are three ways to express straight line equations: general formula, point-to-point formula, and parametric formula. PCL uniformly adopts the point-to-point formula, the point-to-point equation of a straight line, and the coordinates of the projection point from a point outside the line to the line
