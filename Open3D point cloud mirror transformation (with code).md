   The transformation matrix of the two-dimensional mirror transformation is: The transformation matrix of the three-dimensional mirror transformation is: Note: The mirror transformation belongs to the reflection transformation, which requires the reflection plane to pass through the origin, while the reflection transformation is not a strict rigid change, so there is deformation.
