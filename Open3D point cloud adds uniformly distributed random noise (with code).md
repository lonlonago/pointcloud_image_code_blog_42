#  I. Overview of algorithms 

##  1. Evenly distributed 

   In probability theory and statistics, a uniform distribution, also known as a rectangular distribution, is a symmetric probability distribution in which the probability of a distribution at the same length interval is equally likely. The uniform distribution is defined by two parameters, a and b, which are the minimum and maximum values on the number line, usually abbreviated as. 

##  2. Main functions 

   The uniform () method of the random module in numpy will randomly generate the next real number in the range [x, y]. The function returns a floating-point number N with values in the range: x < = N < = y if x < y, y < = N < = x if y < x.
