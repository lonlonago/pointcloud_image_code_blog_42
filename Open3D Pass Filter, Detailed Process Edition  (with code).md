#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

    The function of the pass filter is to filter out the points whose values are not within the given range in the direction of the specified dimension. The implementation principle is as follows: First, specify a dimension and the range under that dimension. Secondly, traverse each point in the point cloud to determine whether the value of the point on the specified dimension is within the range. Delete the points whose values are not within the range. Finally, the traversal is completed, and the remaining points constitute the filtered point cloud. The pass filter is simple and efficient, and is suitable for operations such as eliminating background.
