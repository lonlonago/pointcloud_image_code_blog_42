#  I. Remarks 

   The operation implemented by this code is relatively simple, find the centroid point of the out-point cloud, subtract the coordinates of the centroid point from each point, and finally save it as point cloud data. It can play a role in hiding the real coordinate information of the point cloud. This step is also one of the small steps in the operations of SVD transformation matrix, principal component analysis covariance matrix, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to write the implementation code.
